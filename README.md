# Wide My Github

Wide My Github is a [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/help/stylish) user style
that widens the layout of [Github](https://github.com/) to make it easier to
work with pull requests and gists.

[Install at userstyles.](https://userstyles.org/styles/97661/wide-my-github)

# ATTENTION: Style deprecated

I'm now using:

 * https://userstyles.org/styles/108591/github-wide
 * https://userstyles.org/styles/108592/github-gist-wide

This style won't be updated anymore.
